# todomvc-flux-react
TodoMVC made with flux+react (for academic purposes)

As an attempt to get up to speed with Flux+React, I decided to rewrite TodoMVC
using these. This repository exists for historical and referential purposes
only.

### Steps to run project:
- `git clone https://github.com/kgraves/todomvc-flux-react`
- `cd todomvc-flux-react`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `open index.html` (or the equivalent on your machine)

I pulled some ideas from flux's
[implementation](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/55480fbccf4efcca8762bfc7afcfb258055ef098/examples/flux-todomvc) of TodoMVC
